# ZeroCopy v8.1.1 - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ llama.cpp Not Working - CLIP/mmproj API Mismatch

**Problem:** The llama.cpp tag `b9581` moved multimodal (CLIP/llava) support from `examples/llava/` to `tools/mtmd/`. The old `clip_model_load()` API was replaced with `clip_init()`. The CMakeLists.txt was looking for files in the wrong locations, causing:
- CLIP/vision support not being compiled
- Compilation failure when trying to use the old `clip_model_load` API

**Solution:**
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to find CLIP/mtmd in `tools/mtmd/` (new location in b9581+)
- Added fallback search paths for backward compatibility
- Fixed `ipc-bridge.cpp` to use `clip_init()` instead of deprecated `clip_model_load()`
- Removed unused `-DLLAMA_BUILD_LLAVA=ON` cmake argument (doesn't exist in b9581)
- Updated stb_image.h path to `vendor/stb/` (new location)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` - Fixed CLIP/mtmd detection paths, added b9581+ compatibility
- `app/src/main/cpp/ipc-bridge.cpp` - Replaced `clip_model_load()` with `clip_init()` API
- `app/build.gradle.kts` - Removed unused cmake arguments

### 2. ✅ MNN Engine Inference Broken

**Problem:** The MNN inference function (`mnnExecuteInference`) never sent the user's prompt to the model. It only called `g_llm->generate(1)` in a loop without first processing the prompt text, producing random/garbage output.

**Solution:**
- Restructured inference to first call `g_llm->response()` to process the prompt and generate the first token
- Added proper prompt building from system + user messages
- Used `g_llm->generate(1)` in a loop only for streaming subsequent tokens
- Refactored cleanup into a helper function to avoid code duplication

**Files Changed:**
- `app/src/main/cpp/mnn-bridge.cpp` - Fixed inference to process prompt before generating tokens

### 3. ✅ GitHub Actions CI Workflow Improvements

**Problem:** The CI workflow had basic Android SDK setup but lacked proper error handling, local.properties generation, and artifact upload on failure.

**Solution:**
- Added `local.properties` generation step
- Added NDK installation verification
- Added APK listing step to confirm build output
- Added build report upload on failure for debugging
- Added `fetch-depth: 1` and `submodules: false` for faster checkout
- Added `--stacktrace` flag for better error reporting

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Comprehensive CI workflow improvements

## Infrastructure Updates

### Build Configuration
- Removed stale `-DLLAMA_BUILD_LLAVA=ON` argument (not supported in b9581+)
- Removed unused `set(LLAMA_FLASH_ATTN ON ...)` from CMakeLists.txt (flash attention is controlled via context params at runtime)
- Updated CLIP/mtmd search paths for llama.cpp b9581 compatibility
- Updated stb_image.h search paths

## Key Technical Details

### llama.cpp b9581 API Changes
- Multimodal: `examples/llava/` → `tools/mtmd/`
- CLIP init: `clip_model_load(path, verbosity)` → `clip_init(path, params)` returning `clip_init_result` struct
- stb_image.h: `examples/stb/` → `vendor/stb/`
- No more `LLAMA_BUILD_LLAVA` option (mtmd is always built as part of llama)

### MNN API Notes
- `Llm::response(input_ids, token_cb, done_cb, max_tokens)` processes prompt + generates tokens
- `Llm::generate(steps)` generates tokens after the prompt has been processed
- Use `response()` first to prime the model, then `generate()` for streaming

## Testing Recommendations

1. **llama.cpp Engine:**
   - Build the APK and install on device
   - Load a GGUF model
   - Verify inference produces coherent text
   - If using vision models, verify mmproj loading works

2. **MNN Engine:**
   - Load an MNN model
   - Verify the model processes the prompt and generates appropriate responses
   - Check logcat for "MNN inference done" messages

3. **CI/CD:**
   - Push to GitHub and verify the Actions workflow completes successfully
   - Check the uploaded APK artifact
   - Verify build reports are available on failure

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adeennour4-dot/zerocopy-llm.git
cd zerocopy-llm

# Build the APK (debug) — pick a flavor, "assembleDebug" alone is ambiguous
./gradlew assembleStandardDebug

# Install on device
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/standard/debug/app-standard-debug.apk
```
